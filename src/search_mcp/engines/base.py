#       their `category` parameter with this, so the JSON Schema the model reads
#       lists every group AND every sub-group. That enum is the only taxonomy an
#       LLM reliably sees at call time, which is why the sub-groups live here
#       rather than in a lookup table it would have to go fetch.
#
# A bare group WIDENS (the specialists for that group, round-robined across
