"""Shared plumbing for keyless JSON / feed API engines.

The base `Engine` knows how to GET an HTML page and parse it. A growing number
of sources are instead plain JSON (or Atom/RSS) APIs, and each one was
re-implementing the same three things: a curl_cffi session with the shared
impersonation and proxy settings, a swallow-everything error boundary, and the
`finalize_results` tail contract.

`JsonApiEngine` owns all three, so a new source is usually just:

    class MyEngine(JsonApiEngine):
        name = "mine"
        categories = frozenset({"paper"})

        def build_url(self, query, max_results, filters=None) -> str:
            return f"https://api.example/search?q={quote_plus(query)}"

        def map_results(self, payload) -> list[SearchResult]:
            ...

Sources needing more than one round trip (PubMed) or a non-JSON body (arXiv's
Atom feed) override `fetch_results` instead.

House rules this enforces for every subclass:
  * **Never raise.** A keyless source that is down, rate-limited, or returning
    nonsense yields `[]`; only the aggregator decides what an empty result
    means. One flaky endpoint must never fail the whole search.
  * **No browser fallback.** An API that returned nothing returned nothing; a
    headless re-render just burns ~1s to get the same empty list.
